        <h4>Design Problem</h4>
        <p>
          How might we educate plant owners about their plants and how to care
          for them, in and around their home?
        </p>
      </div>

      <!-- Research -->

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
        <p>
          To begin the research process, we analyzed existing apps in our
          problem space to gain insight on the current market. The analyzed apps
          were: PictureThis, Planta, Gardenia, Dog Scanner, Shroomify, and
          YouTube channels dealing with plant care topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          By conducting our competitive analysis on apps in a similar target
          space, we were able to identify key features we should include in our
          own app design as well as certain features that may not be as relevant
          or desired to our target audience. Overall, this, in combination with
          our user interviews and key insights, informed the design decisions
          and ideation process needed for our final prototype.
        </p>
        <h4>User Interviews</h4>
        <p>
          In order to fully understand the problem space, we conducted user
          interviews to gain insight on what needs the potential users of our
          app would have, as well as understanding their current life and daily
          workflow with respect to how our app would fit within that.

          <b>
            Individuals use a variety of mediums to learn and understand how to
            better care for their plants.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          90% of all interviewees indicated that online resources are their
          source of knowledge and where they go to find new information.
          Combining a variety of mediums such as YouTube, mobile apps,
          discussion forums and graphics/diagrams , individuals can form a
          better understanding on how to take best care of their specific plants
          in their specific circumstance/situation.

            sunlight.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          When asked what plant care looks like to them, 4/5 novice plant owner
          interviewees described plant care as water and sunlight. As one
          interviewee said, "it's just a plant so it just needs water and
          sunlight." This is very different from experienced plant owners, who
          acknowledge many more areas of interest that plant care requires
          (including soil pH, root care, and humidity). This indicates that
          novice plant owners could greatly benefit from plant care education
        </p>

        <p>
          <b
            >Plant owners don't want to keep a strict schedule for plant care,
            but still want to be consistent.
          </b>
        </p>
        <p>
          We found that 8 out of the 10 plant owners we interviewed didn't have
          or want to implement a strict schedule for plant care. Yet,
          consistency was still listed as a goal by the majority of
          interviewees. Plant owners would rather determine care based on needs
          rather than following a strict schedule. This can be seen in notes on
          the affinity map below, where the "flexible schedule" area contains
          user tendencies we recorded. According to botanists, "plants thrive on
          consistency," making consistent care an important factor whether users
          actively seek to achieve it or not.

        <h3>The Design Process</h3>
        <h4>Design System</h4>
        <p>
          We created a design system for Lilo with a goal of establishing a
          welcoming, playful, and relaxing atmosphere within the design. We
          aimed to create a minimalist and friendly experience to foster a sense
          of introspection and help students feel at ease while reflecting on
          their thoughts and feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The purpose of the design system was to remain consistent throughout
          our design process, for a uniform look and feel. Along with updating
          the design system for a more cohesive look, we also updated Lilo to
          look and feel like a more playful robot.

            stay consistent
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Personas</h4>
        <p>
          To better represent our insights through actionable means, we created
          user personas of our target audience. These personas allowed us to
          better understand our user's needs, possible backgrounds, and goals
          for navigating our app. Using this knowledge, we were able to ensure
          we addressed all relevant user goals and needs in the design of our
          app. Doing this early in the design process, allows to keep in mind
          the features this type of audience may find more useful and design for
          the needs identified.

        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>
          To more clearly show how users will be navigating our app, we created
          a user flow chart. This chart depicts how users would likely be using
          the different features of our app.

        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          After evaluating and critiquing our sketches within our group, we
          found that there were changes to be made in our sketches to include
          into our mid-fi wireframes, as well as other features we wanted to
          include. Our full feature list includes: onboarding, plant
          encyclopedia, reminders, plant scanner, explore, and user profile.

              search bar for easier navigation. Once the desired plant is

        <h3>User Testing</h3>
        <p>
          To evaluate our high-fidelity prototype, we created a usability
          testing process. This process was designed for an interviewer to walk
          a user through a series of tasks, testing the usability of the screens
          and flows we included. We ended up conducting usability tests on 5
          users, all new or interested plant owners (our target audience). Users
          really liked the app's interface, with an average overall rating of
          8.4/10
        </p>

        <h4>User Feedback: Positive</h4>
        <p>
          1. Reminder system is highly appreciated - 3/5 users mentioned that
          the reminder system was helpful. This verified our initial hypothesis
          that the reminders would be useful to new and interested plant owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          2. Scanning feature is convenient and of high value to these new plant
          owners - 3/5 users expressed praise for the convenience of the
          scanning feature, indicating that it relieved a key pain point for our
          target users.
        </p>

        <h4>User Feedback: Negative</h4>
        <p>
          1. Hamburger menu caused confusion since it wasn't utilized - 4/5
          users commented about the hamburger menu, due to its lack of
          functionality during usability testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          2. Button contrast can be improved - locating buttons was difficult at
          times due to poor visibility. Several participants mentioned that the
          color of buttons or other icons made it difficult to locate/recognize
          as clickable items.

        <h3>Reflections</h3>

        <h4>What I learned:</h4>
        <p><b>The entire process is important!</b></p>
        <p>
          Throughout the 10 week process we learned a lot about each step of the
          design process. At a high level, we learned how to explore a problem
          space, narrow the problem space, build a solution that solves the
          problem, and finally refine that solution based on user feedback.
        </p>

        <p>
          Getting started with this project, I expected the design journey to be
          more fast paced; however, we spent a long time on the research and
          ideation process prior to jumping into the actual design process. At
          first it felt like the project was moving slowly, in comparison to
          other projects I worked on, but it was actually very useful to
          carefully plan out our design problem statement and research the why
          behind our problem. Taking my time with researching and processing my
          ideas on the project really did help ensure the project was focused on
          what users actually needed.
