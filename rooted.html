            In order to make the plant identification process easier and faster,

          <p>
            Users mentioned that they wanted to be more informed about their
            plants in order to feel more readily prepared to care for them. To
            accomplish this goal, we implemented a plant encyclopedia which
            provides a list of alphabetically sorted plant names, as well as a
            search bar for easier navigation. Once the desired plant is
            selected, an information card of the plant is presented,

          To evaluate our high-fidelity prototype, we created a usability
          testing process. This process was designed for an interviewer to walk
          a user through a series of tasks, testing the usability of the screens
          and flows we included. We ended up conducting usability tests on 5

        <p>
          Getting started with this project, I expected the design journey to be
          more fast paced; however, we spent a long time on the research and
          ideation process prior to jumping into the actual design process. At
          first it felt like the project was moving slowly, in comparison to
          other projects I worked on, but it was actually very useful to
          carefully plan out our design problem statement and research the why
          behind our problem. <span class="highlighter">Taking my time with researching and processing my
          ideas on the project really did help ensure the project was focused on
          what users actually needed.</span>
