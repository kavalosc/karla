             Our team designed a mobile application to better educate plant owners about

        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          I worked as a UI/UX Designer on this project from the researching
          process, interviewing, early ideation stage, wireframes, and user
          testing. I worked in a team of 6, with 5 other designers. Figma was
          our main design tool, but miro was also incorporated in our
          brainstorming process.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
          Becoming a plant parent has become increasingly popular in recent
          years (especially since quarantine has had many people exploring
          different hobbies), and many new people are becoming interested in
          joining this niche group of plant owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, our research shows that
          <span class="highlighter">
            many new plant owners find plant care more difficult than expected,
          </span>
          with some even comparing plant parenthood as being more stressful than
          getting a root canal.
        </p>
        <p><b>Problem Statement: How might we educate plant owners about their plants and how to care for them, in and around their home?

            In order to make the plant identification process easier and faster,

              quicker rate than searching through plant images/names
            </li>
            <li>

          <p>
            Users mentioned that they wanted to be more informed about their
            plants in order to feel more readily prepared to care for them. To
            accomplish this goal, we implemented a plant encyclopedia which
            provides a list of alphabetically sorted plant names, as well as a
            search bar for easier navigation. Once the desired plant is
            selected, an information card of the plant is presented,

            <li><b>Scheduling:</b> by having an entire schedule laid out, users can see in advance what their plant will need at a future date and plan accordingly.

          To evaluate our high-fidelity prototype, we created a usability
          testing process. This process was designed for an interviewer to walk
          a user through a series of tasks, testing the usability of the screens

        <p><b>The entire process is important!</b></p>
        <p>
          Throughout the 10 week process we learned a lot about each step of the
          design process. At a high level, we learned how to <span class="highlighter">explore a problem
          space, narrow the problem space, build a solution that solves the
          problem, and finally refine that solution based on user feedback.</span>
        </p>

        <p><b>Research is essential to creating designs that solve problems</b></p>
        <p>
          Getting started with this project, I expected the design journey to be
          more fast paced; however, we spent a long time on the research and
          ideation process prior to jumping into the actual design process. At
          first it felt like the project was moving slowly, in comparison to
          other projects I worked on, but it was actually very useful to
          carefully plan out our design problem statement and research the why

          ideas on the project really did help ensure the project was focused on
          what users actually needed.</span>
