        <h3>Reflections</h3>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          When I first joined this project, I was less familiar with front-end
          development, and found it a bit challenging to switch from the design
          process into the middle coding process. However, as I continued to
          research React and started communicating with the coding lead for
          clarification, I was able to work quicker and got more used to the
          coding process as well. Overall, I think this was an amazing
          experience that got me out of my comfort zone but in a good way!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge was that oftentimes, the team would work remotely at
          separate times. This would sometimes make it difficult to note what
          was being worked on, what had been completed by someone else, and what
          still needed to be completed. In order to fix this, however, we were
          able to update a sprint sheet with our assigned tasks and also
          delegate tasks in our in person meetings.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          Working on GameIn was a very big opportunity for me to work on my
          design, coding, and communication skills all at once. I had the
          opportunity to work closely with the sponsor; this allowed me to voice
          my thoughts on existing designs, design new mockups, and allowed me to
          remain open for feedback in case any changes had to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          One main thing that I learned from this experience was to be open to
          feedback at any stage of design. When designing, we had a lot of
          freedom of how we wanted to represent certain pages, so the feedback
          sessions from the sponsor were very important to letting us know what
          elements we should keep or change in order to satisfy what they
          actually wanted or envisioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing I learned was to always communicate with the team.
          Oftentimes, our team would work at different times, so in order for
          everyone to be on the same page after working hours, we began to keep
          a log of assigned tasks in a sprintsheet and delegated these tasks in
          our group meeting times. This made sure to keep everything organized
          and evenly distributed tasks throughout the team.
