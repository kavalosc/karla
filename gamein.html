        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          GameIn aims to provide an established integrated team find,
          sponsorship, certification, and transfer market platform in the gaming
          and eSports industry. The vision for the platform strives to define
          GameIn as a leading matchmaking system between eSports teams and
          sponsorship organizations. It serves as a "one-stop-shop" for endemic
          and non-endemic stakeholders looking for teams, influencers, athletes,
          coaches, partners, and investment opportunities in order to improve
          their business and achieve strategic goals.

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Due to limited access to counselors, numerous students lack the
          necessary support to express their nervousness about transitioning to
          college. However, relying on chatbots to address these needs can
          create conflicts as chatbots primarily focus on providing resources or
          quick responses to inquiries, often overlooking the emotional needs of
          students.

      <!-- Design Journey -->
      <div class="row">
        <h3>The Design Process</h3>
        <h4>Requirements Document</h4>
        <p>
          When creating GameIn, we wanted to make sure we clearly understood
          what the sponsors were asking us to do, so to clearly visualize this,
          we created a written document containing all the requirements of the
          project details.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this document, we planned a layout of what pages we would need and
          the possible content that would be on each page. After double checking
          with our sponsor’s that our requirements document aligned with their
          vision, we proceeded to create a user flow diagram to better visualize
          the information in the document.
        </p>

        <h4>User Flow</h4>
        <p>
          The user flow diagrams helped to envision the way users would navigate
          through GameIn, and plan for potential differences depending on the
          user’s main goal (organization, team, or player).
        </p>
        <p>
          We mainly focused on creating 4 pages: Create Teams Page, User Profile
          Page, a Dashboard Page, and a Chat Page.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/gamein/userflo.svg" />
        <div class="caption">
          <p>User flow diagram</p>
        </div>

        <h4>Wireframes</h4>
        <p>
          After finalizing the flow and content of each page, we began working
          on converting user flows into wireframes. In one of our earlier
          iterations of the create team page, which prompts the user to link
          their social media account, we ran into problems concerning the adding
          of accounts and design of the progress bar; there was no way to add
          multiple accounts of the same social media, and the minimalism of the
          progress bar was not very informative. We fixed these issues by adding
          a popout which allowed users to add as many accounts as they liked,
          and upgraded the progress bar to more easily convey to the user where
          exactly in the create team process they are by adding numbered steps
          and subject labeling. Our low-fidelity mockups allowed us to visualize
          this and make changes in the early stages so we can avoid further
          problems in later design stages.

        <p>After more rounds of feedback we created mid fidelity wireframes.</p>

        <div class="caption">

        </div>

        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>
          After our mid-fidelity wireframes were approved, they were sent over
          to the graphic designer on the team who mocked up high fidelity
          renditions of the design. Once he completed these, they were sent back
          to the team so they could be coded into a functioning prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using ReactJS as our coding language and Amazon AWS to host our
          project, we were able to collaboratively work on the coding process.
          We closely followed the mockups made by the Graphic Designer and made
          sure to also keep in mind usability guidelines.

        <h3>Reflections</h3>

        <h4>Challenges</h4>
        <p>
          When I first joined this project, I was less familiar with front-end
          development, and found it a bit challenging to switch from the design
          process into the middle coding process. However, as I continued to
          research React and started communicating with the coding lead for
          clarification, I was able to work quicker and got more used to the
          coding process as well. Overall, I think this was an amazing
          experience that got me out of my comfort zone but in a good way!
        </p>
        <p>
          Another challenge was that oftentimes, the team would work remotely at
          separate times. This would sometimes make it difficult to note what
          was being worked on, what had been completed by someone else, and what
          still needed to be completed. In order to fix this, however, we were
          able to update a sprint sheet with our assigned tasks and also
          delegate tasks in our in person meetings.
        </p>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <p>
          Working on GameIn was a very big opportunity for me to work on my
          design, coding, and communication skills all at once. I had the
          opportunity to work closely with the sponsor; this allowed me to voice
          my thoughts on existing designs, design new mockups, and allowed me to
          remain open for feedback in case any changes had to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          One main thing that I learned from this experience was to be open to
          feedback at any stage of design. When designing, we had a lot of
          freedom of how we wanted to represent certain pages, so the feedback
          sessions from the sponsor were very important to letting us know what
          elements we should keep or change in order to satisfy what they
          actually wanted or envisioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another thing I learned was to always communicate with the team.
          Oftentimes, our team would work at different times, so in order for
          everyone to be on the same page after working hours, we began to keep
          a log of assigned tasks in a sprintsheet and delegated these tasks in
          our group meeting times. This made sure to keep everything organized
          and evenly distributed tasks throughout the team.
