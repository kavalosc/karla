                            <p>When asked what plant care looks like to them, 4/5 novice plant owner interviewees described plant care
                                 as water and sunlight. As one interviewee said,
                                  <b>"it's just a plant so it just needs water and sunlight."</b> This is very different from experienced plant
                                   owners, who acknowledge many more areas of interest that plant care requires (including soil pH, root
                                    care, and humidity). This indicates that novice plant owners could greatly benefit from plant

                            <p>We found that 8 out of the 10 plant owners we interviewed didn't have or want to implement a strict 
                                schedule for plant care. Yet, consistency was still listed as a goal by the majority of interviewees.
                                 Plant owners would rather determine care based on needs rather than following a strict schedule.
                                  This can be seen in notes on the affinity map below, where the "flexible schedule" area contains user 
                                  tendencies we recorded. According to botanists, <b>"plants thrive on consistency,"</b> making consistent
                                   care an important factor whether users actively seek to achieve it or not.</p>

                        <p>
                            
                            Throughout the 10 week process we learned a lot about each step of the design process.
                             At a high level, we learned how to explore a problem space, narrow the problem space,
                              build a solution that solves the problem, and finally refine that solution based on
                               user feedback. </p>


                        <h2>2. Don't get fixated on a potential solution during the research process</h2>
                        <p>When researching the problem, I was constantly thinking of potential solutions rather than just focusing solely on the 
                            factual information. However, during the interview process, I realized some of my possible solutions were not actually wanted/needed by the users.
                            At this point, I realized I should focus solely on the research information and data I was collecting and not jump ahead in order to avoid limited solutions or unwanted features.
