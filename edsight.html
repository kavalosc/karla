Edsight is designed to fit current practices of educators. It facilitates conversations around pedagogical improvements for teachers, facilitators, and district leaders. </p>

                        <p>The absence of a design system for Edsight proved to be a significant problem when we attempt to iterate designs. The issue of consistency and lack of accessibility in the designs decreased the coherence of the site and our productivity. To resolve these issues, we spent some time developing an accessible and well-thought out design system for Edsight.

                        <p>A key point of emphasis we kept in mind while building our design system was accessibility. We wanted to ensure that users with different backgrounds will be able to easily interact with our software.</p>
                        <p>We focused on testing the color contrast for all of our brand colors to make sure we had sufficient contrast across all of our components. This allows users to easily differentiate between different components. Additionally, we focused on choosing a font that has easily distinguishable height differences and characters so that it is readable in different contexts.

                        <p>To establish the major themes and style of our design system, we created a moodboard to collect inspiration and help brainstorm different ideas. From our brainstorming sessions, we identified a few key pillars for our design system: friendly, schoolhouse, handwritten, warm, and in progress. 
                        </p>

                        <p>With Edsight being a tool for teachers to use in the classroom, we wanted to make sure that our design system reflected the aesthetics and atmosphere of a classroom. We took inspiration from different items that are typically found in a classroom. However, we also looked at other education softwares for modern inspiration. By doing so, we were able to create a comprehensive moodboard to guide us throughout the creation of our design system. </p>

                        <p>When selecting typography, we championed clarity. We compared o to 0 and I to l to 1 for legibility and distinguishability, before settling on the work sans font. In the comparisons of often mistaken characters, we looked for how distinguishable these characters were from each other to assess clarity. The Work Sans font ultimately had the clearest readability since it ensured each character was distinct and legible.

                        <p>We were assigned weekly readings with topics that relate to improving the education systems, which we have applied the concepts we learned into our design process in hopes of improving the Edsight. A key practice we applied to our work is human-centered design. The first step is to understand the problem instead of jumping to create solutions. Since we are designing a product that would be used for teachers and instructional coaches, focusing on issues of cognitive load, attention, human perception, and data literacy would be beneficial in creating better experiences for users who often work collaboratively, have busy days with little structured time for reflection, and need to quickly pick up new tools.

                            <p>Our main goal was to keep accessibility in consideration throughout our design decisions to increase the user’s experiences when using Edsight. Initially, we understood that it is important to consider accessibility, but we did not realize how much small decisions matter. To expose ourselves to more accessibility practices, we read articles relating to this topic and realized that elements like typography and colors, even though they may be minor decisions to us, may cause a huge constraint and have a negative impact on potential users.

                                <p>To keep things consistent, we have created a design system to manage our components, color, and text, allowing other designers to use the same elements throughout the design. Although we have a set design system, we ran into inconsistency issues when designing. A problem we ran into was not specifying the amount of spacing between cards and headers. Instead of assuming and estimating the spacing between these elements, we caught this early on and communicated the amount of spacing we should have between these elements. As projects get larger, it is common to miss elements in the initial planning process. Rather than having a lot to fix later, we minimize the number of changes by catching these missing elements, fixing them early on, and saving time in the long run.
