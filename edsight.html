                        <h2>A new way to visualize data</h2>
                        <p>Edsight is a free data analytics platform designed to assist educators in pedagogical improvements (specifically mathematical courses) through data and reflection. Edsight is designed to fit current practices of educators. It facilitates conversations around pedagogical improvements for teachers, facilitators, and district leaders. </p>

                        <h2>Why Edsight needed a design system</h2>

                        <p>The absence of a design system for Edsight proved to be a significant problem when we attempt to iterate designs. The issue of consistency and lack of accessibility in the designs decreased the coherence of the site and our productivity. To resolve these issues, we spent some time developing an accessible and well-thought out design system for Edsight.

                        <h2>Challenges to making a design system</h2>
                        <p>A key point of emphasis we kept in mind while building our design system was accessibility. We wanted to ensure that users with different backgrounds will be able to easily interact with our software.</p>
                        <p>We focused on testing the color contrast for all of our brand colors to make sure we had sufficient contrast across all of our components. This allows users to easily differentiate between different components. Additionally, we focused on choosing a font that has easily distinguishable height differences and characters so that it is readable in different contexts.

                        <h2>Brainstorming the moodboard</h2>

                        <p>To establish the major themes and style of our design system, we created a moodboard to collect inspiration and help brainstorm different ideas. From our brainstorming sessions, we identified a few key pillars for our design system: friendly, schoolhouse, handwritten, warm, and in progress. 
                        </p>

                        <p>With Edsight being a tool for teachers to use in the classroom, we wanted to make sure that our design system reflected the aesthetics and atmosphere of a classroom. We took inspiration from different items that are typically found in a classroom. However, we also looked at other education softwares for modern inspiration. By doing so, we were able to create a comprehensive moodboard to guide us throughout the creation of our design system. </p>

                        <p>When selecting typography, we championed clarity. We compared o to 0 and I to l to 1 for legibility and distinguishability, before settling on the work sans font. In the comparisons of often mistaken characters, we looked for how distinguishable these characters were from each other to assess clarity. The Work Sans font ultimately had the clearest readability since it ensured each character was distinct and legible.
