        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>
          We are the Prosocial Design Team at the
          <a class="link" href="https://sites.uci.edu/daplab/"
            >UC Irvine Design and Partnership Lab</a
          >. At the daplab, we combine research and design to create educational
          tools. As the design team for The Prosocial Card Game, our job is to
          ensure our project conveys a message of prosocial behavior while
          upholding simple and usable design features.

        <h3>The Problem?</h3>
        <p><i>Problem</i></p>
        <p>
          "Prosocial behavior is linked to an increased amount of self-esteem,
          academic success, positive relationships, and overall treatment of
          others. However, there has been a downward spiral of prosocial
          behaviors in adolescents that can adversely affect their empathic
          reasoning."

        </div>

        <p><i>User Goal: </i></p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to help promote prosocial behavior and make users aware of
          the consequences of their actions, especially in adolescents (aged
          13-19).
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to help motivate adolescents to put into practice and develop
          prosocial skills, we created a board game that allows users to
          collaboratively work together to solve social dilemmas. Throughout the
          game, players can explore different emotional takes on situations and
          see through various perspectives. Ultimately, the goal of the game is
          to promote empathy within the players and see how each decision
          affects the scenarios, also promoting awareness.

        <h3>Design process</h3>
        <p><i>Design Guidelines</i></p>
        <p>
          In order to <b>maintain a cohesive look</b> within the overall design
          of the cards, board, and additional material (such as the storybook
          and comic strips), I created a small design system to follow
          throughout the design process.
        </p>
        <p>
          The font chosen for this project was Inter because itâ€™s a
          <b>very clean and readable</b> font. The <b>high legibility</b> drew
          me to choose this font for our design.
        </p>
        <img src="assets/prosocial/styletile.svg" />
        <div class="caption"><p>Style Tile of the Prosocial Card Game</p></div>
        <p>
          The colors chosen are directly related to the colors we found to be
          most closely related to our core 5 emotions: Joy (Yellow/Orange),
          Anger (Red), Disgust (Green), Sadness (Blue), and Fear (Purple).
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p><i>Card Design</i></p>
        <p>
          Initially, we wanted the emotion cards to present two measures of the
          game: one measuring the impact on the played card and the other
          measuring the effect on all the other emotions. The played card would
          increase in points, while all the rest decreased until one inevitably
          hit zero or the game was won; however, we scrapped this idea because
          we wanted to focus on the positive and did not want to take away
          points from any emotion.
        </p>

        <div class="caption">
          <p>Reducing text and increasing visual cues in the card design</p>
        </div>
        <p>
          In addition, we wanted to move away from using text as descriptors and
          focus on creating stories and features that could be easily understood
          in a visual format. Since our game is focused on younger children from
          impoverished countries, mainly those residing in Spanish detention
          centers, they do not have access to the same opportunities and
          education systems as are available here in the U.S.. Thus, we wanted
          this game to be easily comprehensible, straightforward, and have a
          clear message of compassion, empathy, and overall prosocial behavior.

      <div class="row">
        <p><i>Board Game Design</i></p>
        <p>
          Since the game focuses on the world impact of emotions and behaviors
          associated with it, I wanted to create a visual representing that all
          the events in the game will take place on Earth, and create that
          visual connection for players.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the board, there are a multitude of white points that each
          represent a story. As the players continue their gameplay, their
          decisions will affect their next path/scenario to move on to.
          Ultimately, the goal is to reach the end of the game board without
          imbalancing the emotions too much. If an emotion reaches its final
          point before reaching the end point, the game should be restarted and
          attempted again.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <p><i>Storybook Design</i></p>
        <p>
          For the storybook design, I wanted the design to resemble a comic
          book; providing visuals for the players and accompanying bits of text
          to help describe the scenes. Text use in this section was kept to a
          minimum.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          Working as a solo UI designer, I proactively made various design
          decisions that shaped the direction of the game. Because of this, it
          was essential that I checked in often with the project leads and
          stakeholders, ensuring that my work continuously reflected their goals
          as well.

        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <h4>1. Get feedback on current designs.</h4>
        <p>
          Although the designs are fully fleshed out, we want to create the best
          experiences for our users. We plan to iterate with the feedback from
          researchers and former teachers we get from the design, making our
          designs as intuitive as possible.
        </p>
        <h4>
          2. Start implementing consistent and accessible designs in React.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Transitioning to develop our designs, we plan to expand our team and
          include developers in the process of creating consistent and
          accessible products. With the team expanding, it may take more time
          for the developers to learn the consistency and accessibility
          concepts. Additionally, we want to explore more accessibility features
          that would potentially increase inclusivity for beyond users of
          colorblindness, such as users with difficult hearing or age-related
          barriers for Edsight.
