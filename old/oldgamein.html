                            By conducting a competitive analysis, we were able to more clearly identify current trends in the gaming industry (in regards to GameIn's main features). 
                            We found that although many of GameIn's main features of having player certification, a sponsor market, and a connection to the E-sports Community, were found in competitors. 
                            Other platforms lacked having all three and mainly followed the route of only focusing on one of these features.
                            Gamein allows users to access to all of these elements in one place, providing a structured organization that allows the E-sports community to matchmake with each other and sponsors in a secure environment.

                            <p>When asked what plant care looks like to them, 4/5 novice plant owner interviewees described plant care
                                 as water and sunlight. As one interviewee said,
                                  <b>"it's just a plant so it just needs water and sunlight."</b> This is very different from experienced plant
                                   owners, who acknowledge many more areas of interest that plant care requires (including soil pH, root
                                    care, and humidity). This indicates that novice plant owners could greatly benefit from plant
                                     care education</p>

                            <p>We found that 8 out of the 10 plant owners we interviewed didn't have or want to implement a strict 
                                schedule for plant care. Yet, consistency was still listed as a goal by the majority of interviewees.
                                 Plant owners would rather determine care based on needs rather than following a strict schedule.
                                  This can be seen in notes on the affinity map below, where the "flexible schedule" area contains user 
                                  tendencies we recorded. According to botanists, <b>"plants thrive on consistency,"</b> making consistent
                                   care an important factor whether users actively seek to achieve it or not.</p>

                        <p>To evaluate our high-fidelity prototype, we created a <b>usability testing process.</b> 
                            This process was designed for an interviewer to walk a user through a series of tasks,
                             <b>testing the usability of the screens and flows</b> we included. We ended up conducting usability
                              tests on 5 users, all new or interested plant owners (our target audience). Users really liked the app's interface, with an average overall rating of 8.4/10

                                indicating that it relieved a key pain point for our target users.

                                        due to poor visibility. Several participants mentioned that the color of
                                        buttons or other icons made it difficult to locate/recognize as clickable items.

                        <h3>1. Communication is key!</h3>
                        <p>
                          In order for everyone to be on the same page and keep our progress steady,
                          our team was constantly updating each other on our own individual progress
                           as well as what each person would do next. In addition, we set up weekly 
                           meetings with our sponsor to update them with what we had done so far and
                            give an opportunity for feedback on our designs. This feedback really 
                            communicated to me what the intentions of our sponsor was and how to properly
                             achieve their vision for GameIn.
                        </p>


                        <h3>2. Be Adaptable</h3>
                        <p>During this internship, I worked on a project in the earlier stages of developement so many
                          ideas were not concrete yet. We went through various low-mid fidelity designs showcasing possible
                          features and oftentimes had a lot of changes to make during feedback sessions. This really 
                          proved the importance of feedback as well as wireframes, since the changes would have been much more 
                          difficult in higher fidelity mockups. Overall, this feeback process gave a lot of insight on 
                          what the future of GameIn would look like so it was important to be attentive to the changes asked by the Sponsor.
