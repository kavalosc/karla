                         (daplab). Our goal is to work together with community partners to make
                          interactive learning tools and improve education. Specifically, we
                           focus on helping students with the college enrollment process and 
                           preventing "summer melt", when accepted students decide not to 
                           attend college.

                    <h3>Who is Lilo?</h3>
                    <p>Lilo is a chatbot that supports high school graduates with their college 
                    enrollment process through text messages. Our main goal was to address the
                     problem of "summer melt," where accepted students decide not to go to college.
                      We studied different factors that contribute to this, such as practical 
                      challenges like missed deadlines and paperwork, as well as the social and 
                      emotional influences that affect a student's decision to attend college.

                    Using natural language processing, Lilo effectively addresses a wide range of 
                    questions that students may have during the enrollment process. It has been
                     trained with specific college information, allowing it to offer timely reminders
                      and provide informative responses. Lilo also has features that help students 
                      think about their feelings and social worries. If students need more help,
                       Lilo can connect them with experienced college mentors
                    The absence of a design system for Edsight proved to be a significant problem 
                    when we attempt to iterate designs. The issue of consistency and lack of
                     accessibility in the designs decreased the coherence of the site and our
                      productivity. To resolve these issues, we spent some time developing an 
                      accessible and well-thought out design system for Edsight.

                    <p>
                        Due to limited access to counselors, numerous students lack 
                        the necessary support to express their nervousness about 
                        transitioning to college. However, relying on chatbots to 
                        address these needs can create conflicts as chatbots primarily
                         focus on providing resources or quick responses to inquiries, 
                         often overlooking the emotional needs of students.

                    <h3>Design System</h3>
                    <p>We created a design system for Lilo with a goal of establishing a
                         welcoming, playful, and relaxing atmosphere within the design.
                          We aimed to create a minimalist and friendly experience to foster 
                          a sense of introspection and help students feel at ease while 
                          reflecting on their thoughts and feelings.
                    </p>
                    <img src="assets/lilo/designSystem.png">
                    <p>The purpose of the design system was to remain consistent 
                        throughout our design process, for a uniform look and feel.
                         Along with updating the design system for a more cohesive 
                         look, we also updated Lilo to look and feel like a more 
                         playful robot.

                    <h3>Sketches</h3>

                    <p>We initially focused on creating sketches and low-fidelity 
                        wireframes for a task management dashboard that would help 
                        students track their enrollment-related tasks for college. 

                    </p>

                    <p>However, as we got a better understanding of summer melt and
                         how to design for AI, we realized we had to consider the
                          socioemotional aspect of the college journey. Our new goal 
                          was to focus on helping students figure out their college 
                          identity, while also creating a sense of community to help 
                          students understand they are not going through this journey 
                          alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>With this new perspective, we went back to the drawing board 
                        to reimagine our initial sketches, transforming them into a 
                        more holistic and reflective journey towards college. Sketches
                         were very important in our feedback process because it 
                         allowed us to give an idea of our vision without the need 
                         for full commitment in this design direction, allowing for
                          more flexibility.

                    <img src="assets/lilo/flow.png">

                    <p>The user flow diagrams helped to envision a new path for Lilo;
                         one where the user is given the option of going through the
                          chat, tasks, or reflection process in their own order. This 
                          helps navigate away from task-oriented Chat Bots, which was 
                          one of our main challenges, and helps users go at their own
                          pace without overwhelming them. We needed to keep in mind 
                          the audience, high school students who are nervous or still
                           unsure if they want to fully commit to college, and ensure
                            we were providing for their possible personality types 
                            (A, B, C, D).

                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, each respective option would lead to its own 
                        reward, this would in turn keep motivating students to 
                        continue completing each portion of the subsections.

                   </p>

                   <p>We also brainstormed different ways to market Lilo and attract users through various storyboards.

                    <h3>Storyboards</h3>

                    <p>In our updated wireframes, we created a digital road trip
                         concept that takes students on a journey towards college. 
                         The road trip consists of multiple stops, each representing 
                         a different task aimed at alleviating worries and providing 
                         valuable information about college life.
                    </p>

                    <p>At the start of the trip, students will be asked to reflect 
                        on what they are excited about and any concerns they might 
                        have regarding college. This input will be used to generate
                         a personalized roadmap tailored to their specific needs and
                          aspirations.
                    </p>

                    <p>At each stop along the road trip, students will have the 
                        opportunity to engage in a chat with Lilo, where they can 
                        seek guidance, ask questions, or express any concerns they 
                        may have. These interactions with Lilo will provide valuable 
                        support and information to the students.
                    </p>

                    <p>After visiting each stop, students will be encouraged to 
                        reflect once again, this time focusing on their excitement
                         for college and any additional worries that may have arisen. 
                         This reflection process allows students to track their 
                         progress, gain confidence, and address any lingering 
                         concerns throughout their journey. In addition, using the 
                         information from this reflection, Lilo can update student’s 
                         roadmaps to fit their new concerns.

                         on what actual high school students would want in Lilo, and

                    <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>Throughout the design process, we often encountered challenges; one main challenge was that when we were designing Lilo, it felt very standard in terms of how a chatbot and checklists work. This meant we were losing touch with the emotional aspects that Lilo initially was aimed to have at its forefront, this led us to think very long and hard about how to incorporate socio-emotional features into our design. </p>

                        <p>To do this, we focused more on Lilo’s emotional chat sections and reflective portions of the site; in turn, we still used tasks as a way to help push students forward but designed them in a way that they are no longer at the forefront of what students have to do, but rather a resource they have available to them. </p>
                        
                        <p>Another challenge we faced was brainstorming ideas on how to get students to continue using Lilo. We brainstormed various ideas, however, they were all very task and progress oriented. Finally, we decided on creating motivation in the form of a rewards system.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>Redesigning Lilo posed a significant challenge for our design team as we found ourselves constrained by preconceived ideas, making it difficult to deviate from the original designs. At first, our initial task-oriented approach overlooked the impact of different personality types but through feedback sessions, we overcame these issues. Additionally, during these collaborative sessions, we actively considered the ethical implications of AI and how we wanted to support counselors rather than replace them, while creating authentic emotional connections over generic responses. With so many ideas, we took a step back and utilized lo-fi wireframes and user flows, allowing us to holistically visualize the user interaction and implement the desired features without overwhelming the students. After creating our mid-fi wireframes, we plan to seek further feedback from our research team to ensure we haven't overlooked any crucial pain points throughout the design process.
